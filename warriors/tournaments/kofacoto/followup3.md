**Follow Up Information on Round 3**  

On [http://www.koth.org/pmars](http://www.koth.org/pmars) a placed a new version of the Perl program
I used to make my p^3 warrior for round 3 of kofacoto.

Look in the "Other" section to download it.

The new version by default goes to the warrior in state 0 when brainwashed,
but it also informs you that it's possible to reach this spot via
brainwashing... pretty slick now.

If you use the input which it shows by default when you run the
program, you get the following output.




C:\CWAR\BIG>perl p3-1.pl input.txt
PSTATE equ 100 ; change this so its tougher to guess

think   ldp.a  #0,      in
        ldp.a  #PSTATE, table
        mod.ba *in,     table
        stp.b  *table,  #PSTATE
table   jmp    }0,      175
        dat    w0,      50
        dat    w1,      177
        dat    w1,      192
in      dat    w0,      6 ; brainwashing with 4 will use this a-field
        dat    w0,      5 ; brainwashing with 5 will use this a-field
        dat    0,       7




I used the new version, and re-ran the battles from Round 3 without
the brainwashing bug.  As expected, Schmidt's warrior, which relied
most heavily on my warrior's bug, was hit hardest, falling from 2nd
place to like 14th place.  Moore's warrior still came in first with
an amazing score thanks to his clairvoyant ability to figure out the
exact step size of my paper!  Look at this line from his warrior!
What a sneaky bastard... hehe.

Anyway, here's the results when I re-ran them without the bug.
